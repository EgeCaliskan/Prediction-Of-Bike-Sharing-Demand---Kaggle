# Prediction-Of-Bike-Sharing-Demand---Kaggle
This project was done as the final project of the first chapter of the AI & ML Fundamentals Nanodegree which I was given access thanks to AWS AI & ML Scholarship. Detailed information can be found in the "report-template.md" file.

## What is this project about?
I aimed to develop a model that has sufficient accuracy to reliably predict how high bike demand would be given certain conditions. I performed exploratory data analysis, tested the performance of different models on the problem and did hyperparameter tuning on the best performing model. For more information on the datasets used, wisit the Kaggle competition [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview)
